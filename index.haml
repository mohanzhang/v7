    %p
      Hi! My name is Mohan Zhang and this is version seven of my online
      home. I used to share quite a bit of my life on these pages, but
      in recent times I've started feeling otherwise. Over the past few
      years, I've become a big fan of being as local and present as
      possible in my life and daily interactions. I really do believe that
      this is the key to happiness.
    %p
      But the Internet has been a big part of my life ever since I first
      started making websites at age 11. The opportunities and connections
      resulting from this exposure cannot be understated. To encourage these
      kinds of connections in my post-facebook world, my website has now become
      a repository of the skills and interests I am developing in my person;
      since these are the exact skills and interests I wish to make the topic
      of my conversations, I was hoping I could inspire you to reach out to me
      on any or all of these subjects.
    %p
      In the boxes below, I display a few "badges" representing my
      individual journeys of learning in various topics. A green background
      means that I am pursuing the subject actively; a yellow background
      means that my efforts have stalled (but would gladly pick things up
      again given the opportunity); and a gray background means that the
      topic of interest is now considered a past passion (i.e. unlikely
      that I will revive it).
    %p
      You will also notice that there is a sequence of wedges that
      light up clockwise from the top. These represent the four stages of
      competence: Unconscious Incompetence (top), Conscious Incompetence
      (right), Conscious Competence (bottom), and Unconscious Competence
      (left). You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">here</a>.
    %p
      Finally, it is worth mentioning that I will never assign the wedge
      representing the last stage of learning (Unconscious Competence) to
      myself. That's where you come in: if you believe me to have achieved
      true and complete competence in any of the badges below, please get
      in touch! It is likely that you, too, will be very proficient in the
      subject matter (for how else could you have judged me to be so?) and
      we just might learn a lot from each other. If we both believe each
      other to be at the UC stage in a certain skill or interest, then
      there's a good chance we both might be, after all!
